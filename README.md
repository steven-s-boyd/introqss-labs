Labs that I developed for "Introduction to Quantitative Social Science" at the University of Chicago (Fall 2021). Feel free to use these for your own edification or in developing your own course materials. Be aware that some of the code may be out of date. Feel free to contact me with questions.

These labs were intended to familiarize students with R and working in R Studio, reinforce theoretical concepts covered in the course, and help them develop foundational skills for higher level quantitative methods courses available to graduate students at the University of Chicago.

Thanks to Molly Offer-Westort and Andy Eggers for their support throughout the quarter and their feedback on these materials.
